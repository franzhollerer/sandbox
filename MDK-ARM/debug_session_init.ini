 * The application uses a software reset to enter the bootloader.
 * The bootloader tests the RCC_CSR:SFTRSTF (software reset flag) to check
 * if a hardware or software reset has occurred. If the bit is not set
 * the reset is not caused deliberately by the application and the
 * bootloader initializes boot_data with 0.
 *
 * Unfortunately when the firmware is loaded via debugger RCC_CSR:STFRSTF
 * and RCC_CSR:PINRSTF are set together, which would let the bootloader
 * to skip the initialization of boot_data.
 *
 * Therefore we write 1 to RCC_CSR:RMVF which clears all reset flags when
 * we start the firmware via debugger.
